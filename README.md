# Solutions to Unsolved Problems in Python 101

This repository contains solutions to problems from the **Python 101 book** that have no solutions provided. These solutions are designed for educational purposes and aim to assist students enrolled in the **2110101 Computer Programming** course at **Chulalongkorn University**.

## File Naming Convention

Each solution file follows the naming format:
- `px_y.py` 
  - `p` stands for "Problem"
  - `x` is the chapter number
  - `y` is the problem's order in that chapter (ranging from 1 to 3)

Example: `P2_3.py` for the third problem in chapter 2
